<li><strong>January 21, 1869</strong> - Rasputin was born a peasant in the small village of Pokrovskoye, along the Tura River in the Tobolsk Governorate (now Tyumen Oblast) in Siberia.He was christened the following day.
<li><strong>1886</strong> Rasputin travelled to Abalak, Russia, some 250 km east-northeast of Tyumen and 2,800 km east of Moscow, where he met a peasant girl named Praskovya Dubrovina. After a courtship of several months, they married in February 1887.
<li><strong>1895</strong> - Rasputin's first child, Dmitry, was born.
<li><strong>1897</strong> - Rasputin had a vision – either of the Virgin Mary or of St. Simeon of Verkhoturye – and left Pokrovskoye to go on a pilgrimage to the St. Nicholas Monastery. He returned to Pokrovskoye a changed man, looking disheveled and behaving differently than he had before. He became a vegetarian, swore off alcohol, and prayed and sang much more fervently than he had in the past
<li><strong>1898</strong> - Rasputin's second child, Maria, was born.
<li><strong>1900</strong> - Rasputin's thrid child, Varvara, was born.
<li><strong>early 1900s</strong> - Rasputin had developed a small circle of acolytes, primarily family members and other local peasants, who prayed with him on Sundays and other holy days.
<li><strong>1902</strong> - He travelled to the city of Kazan on the Volga river, where he acquired a reputation as a wise and perceptive starets, or holy man, who could help people resolve their spiritual crises and anxieties.
<li><strong>1903</strong> - Rasputin traveled to St. Petersburg. Archimandrite Feofan was so impressed with Rasputin that he invited him to stay in his home and became one of Rasputin's most important and influential friends in St. Petersburg.
<li><strong>1905</strong> - Rasputin had formed friendships with several members of the aristocracy, including the "Black Princesses", Militsa and Anastasia of Montenegro, who had married the tsar's cousins (Grand Duke Peter Nikolaevich and Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich).
<li><strong>November 1, 1905</strong> - Rasputin was first introduced to the tsar and tsarina, at the Peterhof Palace, as a healer who could help their son. Rasputin became "an indispensable member of the royal entourage" as a result.
<li><strong>Summer of 1912</strong> - Alexei developed a hemorrhage in his thigh and groin after a jolting carriage ride near the royal hunting grounds at Spala, which caused a large hematoma.  The tsarina sking him to pray for Alexei.  Rasputin wrote back quickly, telling the tsarina that "God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much."   Alexei's bleeding stopped the following day.
<li><strong>December 1906</strong> - Rasputin had become close enough to the royal family to ask a special favor of the tsar: that he be permitted to change his surname to Rasputin-Novyi.
<li><strong>July 12, 1914</strong> - A 33-year-old peasant woman named Chionya Guseva attempted to assassinate Rasputin by stabbing him in the stomach outside his home in Pokrovskoye. Rasputin was seriously wounded, and for a time it was not clear that he would survive. After surgery and some time in a hospital in Tyumen, he recovered.
Guseva was found to be not responsible for her actions by reason of insanity.
<li><strong>December 30, 1916</strong> - Prince Felix Yusupov claimed that he invited Rasputin to his home shortly after midnight and ushered him into the basement. Yusupov offered Rasputin tea and cakes which had been laced with cyanide. Rasputin initially refused the cakes but then began to eat them and, to Yusupov's surprise, he did not appear to be affected by the poison. Rasputin then asked for some Madeira wine (which had also been poisoned) and drank three glasses, but still showed no sign of distress. At around 2:30 am, Yusupov excused himself to go upstairs, where his fellow conspirators were waiting. He took a revolver from Dmitry Pavlovich, then returned to the basement and told Rasputin that he'd "better look at the crucifix and say a prayer", referring to a crucifix in the room, then shot him once in the chest. The conspirators then drove to Rasputin's apartment, with Sukhotin wearing Rasputin's coat and hat in an attempt to make it look as though Rasputin had returned home that night. They then returned to the Moika Palace and Yusupov went back to the basement to ensure that Rasputin was dead. Suddenly, Rasputin leapt up and attacked Yusupov, who freed himself with some effort and fled upstairs. Rasputin followed and made it into the palace's courtyard before being shot by Purishkevich and collapsing into a snowbank. The conspirators then wrapped his body in cloth, drove it to the Petrovsky Bridge, and dropped it into the Malaya Nevka River.
